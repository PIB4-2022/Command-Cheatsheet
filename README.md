# Command-Cheatsheet

- [x] Create a github shared repository for Command cheatsheets
- [ ] Each student creates her/his files as `{GithubPseudo}-{focus}.ext`.<br>Example: `Jasmine-bash.md` or `Jasmine.md`.
- [ ] Each student then share in it his/her favorite commands and notes on a clean, minimalist format
- [ ] Learn make

### Recommended format

```
$ command                  # comment
```

Example : `Jasmine-bash.md` file.
Content: 

```bash
## Print command
$ echo "Rice" > sushi.txt               # Print "Rice" string into sushi.txt file, replacing all content
$ echo "Salmon" >> suchi.txt            # Print "Salmon" string into suchi.txt file, appending to content

## Replace content command
sed -i 's/almon/ardine/g' suchi.txt     # Replace all (g) occurence of "almon" by "ardine" in suchi.txt
```

### Aim
**Low strategy:** the immediate return is to practice git and store safely your recently learnt commands.
The repository will be shared among the class of 12 and co-edited. You can therefor pool together your learning, develop directory structures, naming conventions, guideline, along the semester, co-edit and refine files.

**High strategy:** If properly lead, this could become a significant and convenient toolbox for your interships and early professional life.
